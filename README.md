## Git Cheatsheet

... well, not really a cheatsheet

Standalone HTML page that organizes Git's commands by what they affect.
Built as I was learning git and trying to understand it. It's proved useful
to others in the same endeavor.

### FAQ

#### Why is it called "Cheat Sheet"?

so I thought I'd just leverage that term. In retrospect, I think this was an
okay tactic, as it brought people to the page.
