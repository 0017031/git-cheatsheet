== Git Cheatsheet

... well, not really a cheatsheet

Standalone HTML page that organizes Git's commands by what they affect.
Built as I was learning git and trying to understand it. It's proved useful
to others in the same endeavor.

=== FAQ

==== Why is it called "Cheat Sheet"?

It's pretty silly, actually. I had a little SEO juice from a couple other real cheat sheets,
so I thought I'd just leverage that term. In retrospect, I think this was an
okay tactic, as it brought people to the page.
